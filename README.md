All Is Cubes
============

This project is (will be) a game engine for worlds made of cubical blocks. The unique feature of this engine is that each ordinary block is itself made out of blocks; each block can be directly edited in the same fashion as the outside world.

Or rather, that's the plan; for now, this is just my very first project written in Rust, and I am aiming to duplicate and expand on the functionality of my previous work [Cubes](https://github.com/kpreid/cubes/). That was written in JavaScript; this I plan to compile to WebAssembly so the result will still run in the browser (hopefully faster), but also support a multiplayer server and storage backend.
